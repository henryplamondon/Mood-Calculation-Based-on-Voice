This algorithm is a Binary CNN for classifying a patient as happy or sad based on the spectrogram data of their voice over 4 second windows. As this is a crude method for determining
a patient's mental state, it is merely a tool for flagging a patient as possibly having a severe mental state (if the score is consistently 0, or sad) or not. It is by no
means a clinical tool and should not be used as such.
